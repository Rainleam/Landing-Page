# Landing Page Project

This project is about to build a multi-section landing page, with a dynamically updating navigational
menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

## Table Of Contents

- HTML - index.html
- CSS - styles.css
- JavaScript - app.js
- Instructions to run the file

## Index.html

This file is the skeleton of the landing page. Within the header, you'll find the Navigation
(starts as empty UL that will be populated with JS). Then you will find the sections. Each Section has an ID
and a data attribute that will populate the li node. Adding more sections will automatically populate nav.
In the end you will find the footer.

## Styles.css

Most of the code here was taken from the skelton code provided by Udacity. I have made some major
changes to the color palette. A special thing to notice here is the style for hover animation on
the active navigation header.

## App.js

This file dynamically adds the content to the page. I have build a dynamic navbar.
To improve the user experience, the section actively being viewed should be differentiated in some way. 
Additionally, when a user clicks on a navigation item, the item should scroll you to the
appropriate section rather than giving you the default jump.
